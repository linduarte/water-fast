# Stash Folder

This folder contains stashed files for future implementation:

## Files:
- `dashboard_with_auth.py` - Complete dashboard with authentication system
  - Uses JSON config file for user credentials
  - Session state management for login
  - Protected content access
  - Ready to implement when authentication is needed

## Usage:
When ready to add authentication, copy the relevant file back to the main directory and configure as needed.
